## Clearing application cache

If the scorecard action tracker application is taking too long to load, and you’re not on a slow network, make sure you have cleared your browser cache.

The Scorecard app makes good use of cached files for a better offline experience, as a result, when installing a higher version, the Scorecard app may use older versions of cached files and thus break down while loading.

Approaches to clear application cache and browser interface, vary from browser to browser; for example for Mozilla Firefox the keyboard shortcut is “CTRL+SHIFT+DELETE” while for Google chrome the keyboard shortcut is “CTRL+SHIFT+J”.

Accessing the interface for clearing browser cache can be done via the following approaches:

• Google Chrome​: Go to the menu icon on the top right corner, and click it to open, go to more tools menu, and choose “Clear browsing data”. Once the interface is open, Make sure, “Clear the following items from” is set to “The beginning of time”.

• Mozilla Firefox​: Go to the menu icon on the top right corner, and click it to open, go to ->Library, and go to History, and choose “Clear recent history”. Once the interface is open, Make sure “Time range to clear” is set to “Everything”, and the “Details” option is expanded to show all details options. Once on the clear browsing data or recent history, tick “Cache”, “Cookies”, “Hosted app data” or “Offline Website Data”. To clear all cached files, cookies, and locally stored data.
